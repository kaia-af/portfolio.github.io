The system that me and my teammates developed will be able to recognize the type of exercise that the mp4 video file inputs. The real time application can count the repetitions of the exercise and come up with the accurate exercise prediction. The results of the program are displayed in the following tab, labeled 1.1. </p>

                    <p> <strong>Game Name: Ramsay's Hell Intern | Grade awarded: 83 [ Distinction ] </strong></p>
                    <p> Ramsay’s Hell Intern is a ground-breaking culinary simulation and competitive gaming experience inspired by the renowned television series, Hell's Kitchen. The game features an AI-driven character modeled after the celebrated chef, Gordon Ramsay, providing an immersive mentoring experience for players. In Ramsay’s Hell Intern, I played a crucial role in developing Level 0, the foundational stage of the game and the fine-tuning of the Ramsay character in CONVAI. This level serves as an essential learning phase, where players, in the role of interns, are guided through the vital mouse & keyboard setting on how to perform basics of culinary arts. I have edited the trailer, which can be viewed in the subsequent tab 2.1 below.  </p>
